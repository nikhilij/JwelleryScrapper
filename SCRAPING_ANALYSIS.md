# PC Jeweller Website Scraping Analysis

## Summary

The PC Jeweller website (https://www.pcjeweller.com/all-jewellery.html) has implemented very strong anti-bot protection measures that are preventing automated scraping. All attempted approaches returned **403 Forbidden** errors.

## Attempted Approaches

### 1. **Basic HTTP Requests** (`jewellery_scraper.py`)
- Used various user agents and headers
- Tried minimal headers and comprehensive browser headers
- **Result**: 403 Forbidden

### 2. **Selenium WebDriver** (`selenium_scraper.py`)
- Attempted browser automation with Chrome/Chromium
- Used headless browsing with anti-detection measures
- **Result**: Failed to load due to bot detection

### 3. **Multiple Fallback Strategies** (`simple_scraper.py`)
- Tried different user agents (desktop, mobile)
- Multiple header configurations
- **Result**: 403 Forbidden for all approaches

### 4. **Sitemap Extraction** (`sitemap_scraper.py`)
- Attempted to access the public sitemap.xml
- Tried alternative accessible pages
- **Result**: 403 Forbidden even for sitemap

## Robots.txt Analysis

The website's robots.txt (accessible) shows:
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: *?filter*
Disallow: /search/
Disallow: /cart/
Disallow: /login/
...
```

This indicates that crawling is **technically allowed**, but the site uses sophisticated bot detection beyond robots.txt.

## Why Scraping Failed

1. **Cloudflare or Similar Protection**: The site likely uses services like Cloudflare that detect and block automated requests
2. **JavaScript Challenges**: The site may require JavaScript execution and challenge solving
3. **Behavioral Analysis**: Advanced bot detection that analyzes request patterns
4. **IP-based Blocking**: Possible blocking of datacenter/cloud IPs

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Browser Inspection
Since automated scraping is blocked, you can manually extract links by:
1. Open the page in a browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Use console commands to extract links:

```javascript
// Extract all links
var links = [];
document.querySelectorAll('a[href]').forEach(function(link) {
    links.push({
        url: link.href,
        text: link.textContent.trim(),
        title: link.title || ''
    });
});

// Download as JSON
var dataStr = "data:text/json;charset=utf-8," + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(links, null, 2));
var downloadAnchorNode = document.createElement('a');
downloadAnchorNode.setAttribute("href", dataStr);
downloadAnchorNode.setAttribute("download", "pcjeweller_links.json");
document.body.appendChild(downloadAnchorNode);
downloadAnchorNode.click();
downloadAnchorNode.remove();
```

### Option 2: Proxy/VPN + Residential IP
- Use residential proxy services
- Rotate IP addresses
- Add random delays between requests

### Option 3: Browser Extension
- Create a browser extension that runs in the user's browser
- Extensions bypass many bot detection systems
- Can extract data while user browses normally

### Option 4: API Investigation
- Check if PC Jeweller has a public API
- Look for mobile app APIs (often less protected)
- Check network requests in browser dev tools

### Option 5: Third-party Services
- Use commercial scraping services like ScrapingBee, Scrapfly
- These services specialize in bypassing bot protection
- Usually paid but more reliable

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

1. **Terms of Service**: Check PC Jeweller's terms of service regarding data scraping
2. **Rate Limiting**: If scraping becomes possible, implement proper delays
3. **Respect robots.txt**: Follow the guidelines even if technically bypassed
4. **Data Usage**: Ensure scraped data is used ethically and legally

## Recommendations

1. **Manual Extraction**: For immediate needs, use the browser console method above
2. **Contact Website**: Consider reaching out to PC Jeweller for data access
3. **Commercial Services**: If this is for business purposes, consider paid scraping services
4. **Alternative Sources**: Look for jewelry data from other sources or APIs

## Files Created

- `jewellery_scraper.py` - Basic requests-based scraper
- `selenium_scraper.py` - Browser automation scraper  
- `simple_scraper.py` - Multiple fallback approaches
- `sitemap_scraper.py` - Sitemap-based extraction
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

All scripts are ready to use but will be blocked by the current bot protection.
